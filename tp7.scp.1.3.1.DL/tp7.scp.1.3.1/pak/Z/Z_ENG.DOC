Use: 	 Z.COM [parameter] [parameter] [parameter]...

	You may used as much parameters, as command line can contain
in. The parameters  should be divided by blank.  The parameters will
be carried  out in sequence. The  program will be stopped  and error
message appered if incorrect parameter is specified.

	The following parameters are allowed:

 /? 		- information about program.

 I 		- interactive  mode.  You  can   choose  a  mode  by
		  pressing  Enter them  the menu  - if  setting mode
		  failed -  press the  blank for return  80x25 video
		  mode.

 L 		- logo of the program.

 ? 		- information  on  the  current  videomode,  without
		  frequency of display.

 without parameters 
 		- switching  from monochrome (7) to  colour (3) mode
		  and back.

 "any.exe"      - in inverted commas  you can specify a  name of the
 'any.exe'        program necessary to run, for example, you want to
		  see  certain   file  in  a  mode   with  the  high
		  resolution - see examples.

 V, E, C 	- emulation  VGA,   EGA  and  CGA  of   the  display		  
 		  accordingly.

 P[+|-] 	- to permit loading a palette by default p+ or p		
 		- to forbid loading a palette by default p- 		  
 		  apply from  the moment of installation  of a video		  mode.

 /p:file_pal 	- to load a palette from a text file.
		  Structure of  a palette  file (size  of a  file no
		  more than  4 Kb). Empty lines  and lines beginning
		  with ";" are ignored.  Each colour is described by
		  three  numbers  (R, G,  B)  in  a range  0..63  in
		  decimal or 0..3Fh in  hexadecimal. The minus means
		  the passing, this place will  be as in the current
		  palette.  Numbers may  be  in one  line,  or in  a
		  column:
		  00 00 00 	; black
		  - - - 	; dark blue (without change)
		  00 20h 0 	; green
		  0 20h 20h 	; light-blue
		  32 - 10 	; red

 \p:file_pal 	- to load a palette from a binary file.
 		  each color described by 3 bytes.

 \f:file_fnt[,?]
 /f:file_fnt[,?]
 		- load a  font from the file. If the  size of a file
		  2048,  3584  or  4096   bytes,  the  program  will
		  believes that number of scanlines in the symbol 8,
		  14  and 16  accordingly.  If the  size  of a  file
		  another, necessary to  specify number of scanlines
		  through a comma. Example: /f:file.ext,14
		  /f - do not reset videomode
		  \f - reset videomode

 + 		- increase of width of symbols up to 9 pixels.
 ++ 		- increase of width of symbols up to 9 pixels.(other)

 - 		- decrease of width of symbols up to 8 pixels.

 G[+|-] 	- suppression of  colour (switch on/off) -  you will
		  see shades  grey instead  of colour  images. Apply
		  from the moment of installation of a video mode.
 		  G+ switch on
		  G- switch off
		  G  change state

 =? 		- instead of  a mark ?  specify decimal number  of a
 ~?		  mode  - maximum  three digits,  otherwise mode  is
		  unpredictable.

 =?h 		- instead of a mark  ? specify hexadecimal number of
 ~?h		  a mode  - maximum of three  digits, otherwise mode
		  is unpredictable.
 
 T or S 	- testing of supported video modes:
		  T - without a sound,
		  S - with a sound, 
		  the result will  be written to a file  Z.TXT it is
		  possible to  specify initial number of  a mode the
		  test is to begin with: 
		    T+13h or T-19 or S+13h or S-19

 Q 		- quiet mode.

 F 		- to test  frequency of  display, it is  possible to
		  measure frequency in any  mode and to set another:
		  Z ~13h f 3

 B[+|-] 	- to operate the blinking and increase brightness of
		  a background.
 		  B or b+ - switch on blinking
 		  B- 	  - switch off blinking

 \92 		- set mode 90 columns on 25 lines
 \93 		- set mode 90 columns on 30 lines
 \95 		- set mode 90 columns on 50 lines

 \?? 		- installation of a mode  80 columns on?? Lines. the
		  following values of lines are allowed:
		  25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 50 (43-EGA)
		  the installation 32 and  36 lines requires 286 and
		  higher.

 \C?? 	 	- installation of  number of columns.  The following
		  values are  supported. (in some cases  the failure
		  of synchronization is possible):
		  80,82,84,86,88,90,92,94,96,98,100,102,104

 [	 	- installation 80x12 ;-)
 ] 	 	- installation 40x12 ;-)
 		  For return to a normal mode: z.com v

 cls[:color]	- clear screen,  color  -  hexadecimal  or   decimal
 		  number.

 w or /w        
 		- hand-operated installation of windowed modes under
		  Windows. Use  arrow keys for changes  of number of
		  lines and columns. Press Escape or Enter for quit.
		  Press  blank for  return  in  80x25 videomode,  if
		  during adjustment  any troubles.  Allowable values
		  are  in an  interval 1..64  for lines,  1..132 for
		  columns.

 w??x?? or /w??x??
	        - installation  of a  windowed modes  under Windows,
		  first  value is  column,  second  value is  lines.
		  Allowable  values are  in  an  interval 1..64  for
		  lines, 1..132 for columns.


	You can also set the following  video modes:

/36x14 		 /40x14[-] 	 /46x14 	 /36x15
/40x15[-] 	 /46x15 	 /36x17 	 /40x17[-]

/90x50 		 /70x60 	 /80x60[-] 	 /90x60

	Accelerated setup of modes
 0 		 - 40x25   mode 0
 1 		 - 40x25   mode 1
 2 		 - 80x25   mode 2
 3 		 - 80x25   mode 3
 4 		 - 80x50   mode 3 or 7 (43 on EGA)
 5 		 - 80x30   mode 3 or 7
 6 		 - 80x34   mode 3 or 7
 7 		 - 80x25   mode 7
 8 		 - 132x30  mode 88
 9 		 - 132x43  mode 89

Possible, your video card does not support all listed video modes.

 VESA modes:
 /V 		 - to receive the information  about VESA modes. the
 \V		   result of  testing will be written  to Z_VESA.TXT
		   file.

 /V=? 		 - to set VESA a mode.  ? is hexadecimal number, can
 \V=?		   have 'h' as the last symbol.
 
 
IT IS IMPORTANT:
if  useing  slash   (/),  installation  of  a   VESA-mode  made  the
preliminary  check, to  infer whether  it is  accessible. If  useing
opposite  slash (\),  check on  availability  is not  made, and  the
attempt to establish a mode will be made.


 Examples:
  Z.COM =3 	 set mode  80x25 

  Z.COM 5 	 set mode  80x30 

  Z.COM \34 	 set mode  80x34 

  Z.COM \93 	 set mode  90x30 

  Z.COM /40x17 	 set mode  40x17, width of symbols 9 pixels

  Z.COM /40x17-  set mode  40x17, width of symbols 8 pixels

  Z.COM =58h F 	 set mode  #58h and to show frequency of display

  Z.COM L \30 	 show logo and then to set a mode 80x30

  Z.COM G- =83h  show grey shades instead of colours and to set mode
                 3 without clearing the video buffer

  Z.COM P + \32  to permit loading a palette by default and  to  set 
                 mode 80x32

  Z.COM =88 "hiew filename.exe" \30
		 To set mode 88, to run the  program  HIEW.EXE  with 
		 FILENAME.EXE  and  to  set  mode  80
		 columns on 30 lines on return

  Z.COM 7 'start http://www.whitetown.com' l =3 \30
		 set monochrome mode,  to run explorer and  to enter
		 the site of the developer  of the program, to regard the
		 logo of the program and establish a
		 colour mode 80 columns on 30 lines on return.

  Z.COM \V 	 to receive the information on VESA-modes

  Z.COM \V =108  set VESA-mode 108h

  Z.COM W	 manual setting of windowed modes

  Z.COM /W98x34	 set windowed mode 98 columns and 34 lines

  Z.COM [	 use, if you  poorly see...

  Z.COM lllllll  to regard logo  many times ;-)

Possible to combine parameters:
  Z.COM \30 \c108 q 'C:\Progra~1\Far\Far.exe'



P.S.
  In the program the same modes can be set with different ways,
  For example:
	 Z.COM 4 	³	In these cases the result
	 Z.COM \50 	ÃÄ>	is the same, but the ways 
	 Z.COM /80x50 	³ 	of setting are different.

P.P.S.
